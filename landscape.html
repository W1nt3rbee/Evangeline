    		<h2>About Eve</h2>
    			<p>The rainforest Eve lives in is humid, it rains often so she feels comforted by the pitter patter of the rain hitting the leaves. Before the rainforest was destroyed she was able to run & jump wherever she wished.</p>
			
				<p>The cave is also humid, and you can still here the pitter patter water coming from the stalactites, but the cave is crowd and full of whisper, Eve cannot run & jump as freely as she did in the caves before. </p>
